"""
In this script, we're going to take the list of company urls we scraped in ``get_companies`` and visit each company
site and crawl through the reviews on each page.

This will be a bit easier to do, as there's no class name mangling on the review pages. We're going to extract the
following information:

Company details:

    Name:   I chose not to grab this at previous steps, since I wanted to do the least amount of scraping

    Categories: It might be interesting to look at sentiment across categories to see if some types of companies get
                different sentiment, especially if that doesn't correlate with a different rating

    Rating: There's a span that's got the number of reviews and a word describing the rating, which should be pretty
            straightforward to parse into a number.

Review details:

    Rating: looks like this is provided as an image, which we certainly don't want to download, but luckilly the src
            attribute of the img tag includes the actual rating number, so we'll strip that out.

    Title:  This is pretty easy to grab, and could be interesting as a lighter feature than the review body.

    Body:   The text of the review. This is what we'll use for our sentiment analysis.


I'm going to try a class based approach for this one, since it'll take the longest and it'll need to be fairly robust.
